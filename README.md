TODOS:
  - add frontend error handling
  - add frontend input validation to offload the server
  - loading functionality
  - fonts
  - fetch classes functionality DONE
  - Store user id in secure storage + global auth context for future requests DONE
  - Store account type in secure storage + global auth context DONE
  - I should figure out what to do on error in axios request, what to render - right now isLoading gets changed to false so it loads the classes page (and retries the request apparently)
  - design loading screen
  - Classes scrolling DONE
  - refresh on pull down DONE
  - student join class functionality
  - render invites at the bottom
  - student leave class functionality
  - check how JSON parses number strings
  - move joinclass, leaveclass to class nodes DONE
  - fake class deletion, or joining in UI (set to invisible on leaveClass, figure out a way to set back to visible on refresh - currently it works on reopening the app) DONE
  - add new class functionality
  - default avatar
  - change password fields to invisible
  - caching in react native + offline acces
  - random avatar generation + storage (generate random injection varaibles to preset svgs and save only the generated values)
  - add proper error displaying
