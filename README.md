TODOS:
  - add frontend error handling
  - add frontend input validation to offload the server
  - loading functionality DONE
  - fonts
  - fetch classes functionality DONE
  - Store user id in secure storage + global auth context for future requests DONE
  - Store account type in secure storage + global auth context DONE
  - I should figure out what to do on error in axios request, what to render - right now isLoading gets changed to false so it loads the classes page (and retries the request apparently)
  - design loading screen DONEish
  - Classes scrolling DONE
  - refresh on pull down DONE
  - student join class functionality
  - render invites at the bottom
  - student leave class functionality DONE
  - check how JSON parses number strings
  - move joinclass, leaveclass to class nodes DONE
  - fake class deletion, or joining in UI (set to invisible on leaveClass, figure out a way to set back to visible on refresh - currently it works on reopening the app) DONE
  - add new class functionality DONE
  - default avatar
  - change password fields to invisible
  - caching in react native + offline acces
  - random avatar generation + storage (generate random injection varaibles to preset svgs and save only the generated values)
  - add proper error displaying
  - maybe move common (background etc.) to separate page template component
  - change element size to smaller (font size in testing phone is set to small, so on regular phones elements will be larger)
  - button DELETE COMPLETED TASKS for teacher
  - maybe change students screen to different layout? maybe tiles
  - all icons same thickness (at least most of them)
  - prevent student from deleting tasks in frontend
  - in build there is a bar on top DONE
  - make square app logo
  - description input field should change size + it is not centered when typing
  - language settings
  - add custom colors to tailwind and use them in app
  - make logo/icon + splash screen
  - if token expires, remove token from storage, handle this globally in app
  - axios makes requests two times in railway (may be some preflight or handshake or whatever)
  - fix error handling,especially in Register nd Login
  - class onPress sometimes doesnt work, happened after adding dyamic background (its probably because the svgt element overflows its container) DONE
  - think of edge cases in student avatar generation
  - white letters in addModal
  - avatars end up on right side most on the time
  - remove class avatar
  - add student avatar to task screen maybe
  - caching for offline data access maybe
  - add graphics for student side classes
  - check out react query for offline access or implement your own persistent offline caching POC DONE
  - appwide offline cache
  - delete cache on logout
